== Introduction

The Holon *JPA* module provides base support for the _Java Persistence API_ (JPA).

It makes available a set of bean _post processors_ to deal with JPA *entity* annotations, which can be used to configure bean properties at bean introspection time.

TIP: See the link:holon-datastore-jpa.html[JPA Datastore^] documentation to learn how to use the `Datastore` API to manage persistent data through a JPA persistence model in an abstract and implementation independent way.

=== Sources and contributions

The Holon Platform *JPA* module source code is available from the GitHub repository link:https://github.com/holon-platform/holon-jpa[https://github.com/holon-platform/holon-jpa^].

See the repository `README` file for information about:

* The source code structure.
* How to build the module artifacts from sources.
* Where to find the code examples.
* How to contribute to the module development.

== Obtaining the artifacts

The Holon Platform uses https://maven.apache.org[Maven^] for projects build and configuration. All the platform artifacts are published in the *Maven Central Repository*, so there is no need to explicitly declare additional repositories in your project `pom` file.

At the top of each _section_ of this documentation you will find the Maven _coordinates_ (group id, artifact id and version) to obtain the artifact(s) as a dependency for your project.

A *BOM (Bill Of Materials)* `pom` is provided to import the available dependencies for a specific version in your projects. The Maven coordinates for the core BOM are the following:

_Maven coordinates_:
[source, xml, subs="attributes+"]
----
<groupId>com.holon-platform.jpa</groupId>
<artifactId>holon-jpa-bom</artifactId>
<version>{revnumber}</version>
----

The BOM can be imported in a Maven project in the following way:

[source, xml, subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes+"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.holon-platform.jpa</groupId>
			<artifactId>holon-jpa-bom</artifactId>
			<version>{revnumber}</version>
			*<type>pom</type>*
			*<scope>import</scope>*
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

=== Using the Platform BOM

The Holon Platform provides an *overall Maven BOM (Bill of Materials)* to easily obtain all the available platform artifacts.

See link:index.html#obtain-the-platform-artifacts[Obtain the platform artifacts] for details.

The `holon-jpa-bean-processors` artifact provides a set of Bean property and property set *post processors* which can be used to inspect standard *JPA entity annotations* on Java Beans to configure the bean properties accordingly when using the Holon Platform _Property model_ and _Bean instrospection_ APIs.

NOTE: See the link:holon-core.html#Property[Property model^] documentation for information about the Holon Platform Property model and the link:holon-core.html#Beans[Java Beans support^] documentation for information about the Holon Platform Java Beans support and the integration strategies with the _Property model_ architecture.

The Holon Platform *Bean instrospection API* supports two types of _post processors_ which can be used to extend and enrich the Bean introspection strategy:

* The link:holon-core.html#BeanPropertyPostProcessor[BeanPropertyPostProcessor^] API at *property* level, which allows to attend in the Bean properties introspection strategy, i.e. the process to transform each Bean property into a Holon Platform link:holon-core.html#PathProperty[PathProperty^] representation, tipically to provide additional property configuration capabilities.

* The link:holon-core.html#BeanPropertySetPostProcessor[BeanPropertySetPostProcessor^] API at *property set* level, which allows to attend in the link:holon-core.html#BeanPropertySet[BeanPropertySet^] creation strategy, providing additional configuration capabilities.

See the <<JPAPropertyPostProcessors>> and <<JPAPropertyPostSetProcessors>> to learn about the available post processors.

=== Post processors registration

The JPA post processors provided by the JPA module relies on the standard _Java service extensions_ feature to *auto-register* themself in the link:holon-core.html#BeanIntrospector[BeanIntrospector] API.

This way, when the `holon-jpa-bean-processors` artifact is available in classpath, the JPA post processors are automatically registered and made available to the Bean introspection API.

IMPORTANT: The JPA API classes must be available in classpath to enable the JPA bean post processors.

==== Direct registration

When the auto registration strategy is not applicable for any reason, the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/jpa/processors/JpaBeanPostProcessor.html[JpaBeanPostProcessor^] API provides a static method to explicitly perform the JPA post processors registration in a `BeanIntrospector` API instance: `registerPostProcessors(BeanIntrospector beanIntrospector)`.

[[JPAPropertyPostProcessors]]
=== JPA bean *property* post processors

==== Entity identifiers (`@Id` and `@EmbeddedId` annotations)

This post processor deals with the JPA `@Id` and `@EmbeddedId` annotations to detect the JPA entity _identifier_ attributes.

Each Bean property declared as JPA entity identifier is declared as Bean `PropertySet` *identifier property*,  using the corresponding `PathProperty` representation.

See the link:holon-core.html#IdentifierProperties[IdentifierProperties^] documentation for information about the property set identifier properties.

==== `@Enumerated` annotation

This post processor deals with the JPA `@Enumerated` annotation.

When the `@Enumerated` annotation is detected on a Bean property, the post processor configures a link:holon-core.html#PropertyValueConverter[PropertyValueConverter^] for the corresponding `PathProperty` to automatically handle the data model value conversions to the Java _enumeration_ type and back, using the *ordinal* or *String* representation according to the `EnumType` declared in the `@Enumerated` annotation.

This post processor skips the converter setup if a `PropertyValueConverter` is already configured for the property, for example using the `@Converter` annotation. See the link:holon-core.html#BuiltinBeanPostProcessors[Builtin Bean post processors^] documentation section for details.

==== `@Temporal` annotation

This post processor deals with the JPA `@Temporal` annotation.

When the `@Temporal` annotation is detected on a Bean property, the `TemporalType` configuration attribute of the corresponding `PathProperty` is setted accordingly to the declared JPA temporal type value.

See the link:holon-core.html#PropertyConfiguration[PropertyConfiguration^] documentation for information about the property temporal type configuration attribute.

==== `@Transient` annotation

This post processor deals with the JPA `@Transient` annotation.

When the `@Transient` annotation is detected on a Bean property, that property will be *ignored* by the Bean introspection API and will not be part of the eventual Bean property set.

==== `@Column` annotation

This post processor deals with the JPA `@Column` annotation.

When the `@Column` annotation is detected on a Bean property or getter method and the `name()` attribute is provided, the *column name* is registered in the corresponding `PathProperty` configuration as *data path* mapping, using the `DataMappable.PATH` configuration property.

See the link:holon-core.html#DataMappable[DataMappable^] documentation for information about the data path representation.

[[JPAPropertyPostSetProcessors]]
=== JPA bean *property set* post processors

==== `@Table` annotation

This post processor deals with the JPA `@Table` entity annotation.

When the `@Table` annotation is detected on a Bean class and the `name()` attribute is provided, the *table name* is registered in the `BeanPropertySet` configuration as *data path* mapping, using the `DataMappable.PATH` configuration property.

See the link:holon-core.html#DataMappable[DataMappable^] documentation for information about the data path representation.

== Loggers

By default, the Holon platform uses the https://www.slf4j.org[SLF4J^] API for logging. The use of SLF4J is optional: it is enabled when the presence of SLF4J is detected in the classpath. Otherwise, logging will fall back to JUL (`java.util.logging`).

The logger name for the *JPA Bean Processors* module is `com.holonplatform.jpa.processors`.

=== JPA entity post processors example

The following example shows how the JPA post processors work during JPA entity bean introspection.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/jpa/examples/JpaPostProcessorsExample.java[tag=postprocessors,indent=0]
----
<1> A sample JPA entity definition: the JPA annotations handled by the post processors are declare at bean class and property level
<2> Obtain a `BeanPropertySet` from the `MyEntity` JPA entity class using bean introspection API
<3> The `PathProperty` with path `id` will be configured as property set _identifier_ property, since the `id` bean property is marked with the `@Id` annotation 
<4> A _data path_ with value `txt` is configured for the `PathProperty` with path `textValue`
<5> the `TemporalType.DATE` is is configured for the `PathProperty` with path `date`  
<6> Since the `toIgnore` bean property is marked with `@Transient`, it is ignored during bean introspection and will not be part of the bean property set

== System requirements

=== Java

The Holon Platform JDBC Datastore module requires https://www.java.com[Java] *8* or higher.

=== JPA API

The *JPA API* classes must be present in classpath to enable JPA beans processing. The Holon JPA module is tested against the JPA API version *2.0*, *2.1* and *2.2*.
